== Bio 
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow jointly in Applied Mathematics at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University and in the Vision Group at the Department of Biology, Lund University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Riverside, working with [http://www.fabiopas.it/index.html Prof. Fabio Pasqualetti]. I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego in 2019, where my advisor was [http://fausto.ucsd.edu/sonia/ Prof. Sonia Martínez]. Before that, I received the B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras in 2014.

== Research
I am interested in the design and analysis of complex and adaptive autonomous systems, with an eye towards applications in robotics. Typical concerns include: 1) Optimality and robustness of performance, 2) Guaranteed safe and secure operation, 3) Scalability of design. Consequently, my efforts are directed towards uncovering the principles of: 1) organization of internal complexity, 2) adaptation to complex environments, 3) the interplay between the above. This places my research at the intersection of optimization, control theory, machine learning and infinite-dimensional analysis.
