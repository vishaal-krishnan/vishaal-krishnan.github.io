== Abstract

  In this work, we propose a unifying framework in the space of
  probability measures for gradient-based and sampling-based
  moving-horizon estimation methods.  We begin with an investigation
  of the classical notion of strong local observability of nonlinear
  systems and its relationship to optimization-based state estimation.
  We then present a general moving-horizon estimation framework for
  strongly locally observable systems, as an iterative minimization
  scheme in the space of probability measures. This framework allows
  for the minimization of the estimation cost with respect to
  different metrics and divergences.  In particular, we consider two
  variants, which we name $W_2$-MHE and KL-MHE, where the minimization
  scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence
  respectively.  The $W_2$-MHE yields a gradient-based estimator
  whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle filter, for which
  we investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties.
  Stability results for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in
  the distributional setting, against the backdrop of the classical
  notion of strong local observability which, to the best of our
  knowledge, differentiates it from other previous works.  We also
  present results from numerical simulations to demonstrate the
  performance of these estimators.
