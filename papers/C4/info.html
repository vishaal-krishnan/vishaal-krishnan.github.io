<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this work, we propose a unifying framework in the space of
probability measures for gradient-based and sampling-based
moving-horizon estimation methods.  We begin with an investigation
of the classical notion of strong local observability of nonlinear
systems and its relationship to optimization-based state estimation.
We then present a general moving-horizon estimation framework for
strongly locally observable systems, as an iterative minimization
scheme in the space of probability measures. This framework allows
for the minimization of the estimation cost with respect to
different metrics and divergences.  In particular, we consider two
variants, which we name \(W_2\)-MHE and KL-MHE, where the minimization
scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence
respectively.  The \(W_2\)-MHE yields a gradient-based estimator
whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle filter, for which
we investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties.
Stability results for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in
the distributional setting, against the backdrop of the classical
notion of strong local observability which, to the best of our
knowledge, differentiates it from other previous works.  We also
present results from numerical simulations to demonstrate the
performance of these estimators.
