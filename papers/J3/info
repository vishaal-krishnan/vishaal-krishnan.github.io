== Abstract  This work proposes a unifying probabilistic framework for the
  design of robustly asymptotically stable moving-horizon 
  estimators (MHE) for discrete-time nonlinear systems, 
  and a mechanism to incorporate differential privacy
  in moving-horizon estimation. We begin with an
  investigation of the classical notion of strong local observability
  of nonlinear systems and its relationship to optimization-based
  state estimation.  We then present a general moving-horizon
  estimation framework for strongly locally observable systems, as an
  iterative minimization scheme in the space of probability
  measures. This framework allows for the minimization of the
  estimation cost with respect to different metrics.  In particular,
  we consider two variants, which we name $W_2$-MHE and KL-MHE, where
  the minimization scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein distance and the
  KL-divergence, respectively.  The $W_2$-MHE yields a gradient-based
  estimator whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle filter, for which we
  investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties.
  Stability results for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in
  the distributional setting, against the backdrop of the classical
  notion of strong local observability which, to the best of our
  knowledge, differentiates it from other previous works.  We then
  propose a mechanism to encode differential privacy of the data
  generated by the estimator, based on an entropic regularization of
  the MHE objective functional. In particular, we find sufficient
  bounds on the regularization parameter to achieve the desired level
  of differential privacy. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
  performance of these estimators.
