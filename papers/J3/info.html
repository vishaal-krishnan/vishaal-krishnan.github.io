<h2>Abstract  This work proposes a unifying probabilistic framework for the</h2>
<p>design of robustly asymptotically stable moving-horizon 
estimators (MHE) for discrete-time nonlinear systems, 
and a mechanism to incorporate differential privacy
in moving-horizon estimation. We begin with an
investigation of the classical notion of strong local observability
of nonlinear systems and its relationship to optimization-based
state estimation.  We then present a general moving-horizon
estimation framework for strongly locally observable systems, as an
iterative minimization scheme in the space of probability
measures. This framework allows for the minimization of the
estimation cost with respect to different metrics.  In particular,
we consider two variants, which we name \(W_2\)-MHE and KL-MHE, where
the minimization scheme uses the 2-Wasserstein distance and the
KL-divergence, respectively.  The \(W_2\)-MHE yields a gradient-based
estimator whereas the KL-MHE yields a particle filter, for which we
investigate asymptotic stability and robustness properties.
Stability results for these moving-horizon estimators are derived in
the distributional setting, against the backdrop of the classical
notion of strong local observability which, to the best of our
knowledge, differentiates it from other previous works.  We then
propose a mechanism to encode differential privacy of the data
generated by the estimator, based on an entropic regularization of
the MHE objective functional. In particular, we find sufficient
bounds on the regularization parameter to achieve the desired level
of differential privacy. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
performance of these estimators.
