== Abstract

 In this work, we propose and investigate a scalable, distributed
  iterative algorithm for large-scale optimal transport of
  collectives of autonomous agents.  
  We formulate the problem as one of steering 
  the collective towards a target probability measure while minimizing
  the total cost of transport, with the additional constraint of
  distributed implementation imposed by a nearest-neighbor
  graph topology. Working within the framework of optimal 
  transport theory, we realize the solution as an 
  iterative transport based on a proximal point algorithm.
  At each stage of the transport, the agents 
  implement an online, distributed primal-dual algorithm 
  to obtain local estimates of the Kantorovich potential
  for optimal transport from the current distribution of the collective 
  to the target distribution.
  Using these estimates as their local objective functions,
  the agents then implement the transport by a proximal point algorithm. 
  This two-step process is carried out recursively by the
  collective to converge asymptotically to the target distribution. 
  We analyze the behavior of the transport
  in the continuous time and~$N \rightarrow \infty$ limit, 
  where the discrete-time transport
  yields a system of PDEs describing the evolution of 
  the density function of the collective,
  and we establish the asymptotic stability of this system of
  PDEs. We also test the behavior of the
  algorithm in simulation.
