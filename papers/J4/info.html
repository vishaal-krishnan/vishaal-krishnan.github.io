<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this work, we propose and investigate a scalable, distributed
iterative algorithm for large-scale optimal transport of
collectives of autonomous agents.  
We formulate the problem as one of steering 
the collective towards a target probability measure while minimizing
the total cost of transport, with the additional constraint of
distributed implementation imposed by a nearest-neighbor
graph topology. Working within the framework of optimal 
transport theory, we realize the solution as an 
iterative transport based on a proximal point algorithm.
At each stage of the transport, the agents 
implement an online, distributed primal-dual algorithm 
to obtain local estimates of the Kantorovich potential
for optimal transport from the current distribution of the collective 
to the target distribution.
Using these estimates as their local objective functions,
the agents then implement the transport by a proximal point algorithm. 
This two-step process is carried out recursively by the
collective to converge asymptotically to the target distribution. 
We analyze the behavior of the transport
in the continuous time and&nbsp;\(N \rightarrow \infty\) limit, 
where the discrete-time transport
yields a system of PDEs describing the evolution of 
the density function of the collective,
and we establish the asymptotic stability of this system of
PDEs. We also test the behavior of the
algorithm in simulation.
